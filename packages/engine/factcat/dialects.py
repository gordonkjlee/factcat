"""Per-dialect SQL that cannot be transpiled.

sqlglot handles almost everything: date arithmetic, casting, string functions,
window functions. Measured across the retention query, exactly one construct
does not survive transpilation cleanly - **generating a series of integers**.

    duckdb      UNNEST(GENERATE_SERIES(0, n))
    snowflake   renders as a double FLATTEN over ARRAY_GENERATE_RANGE
    redshift    fails outright: "Unsupported EXPLODE() function"

So the period grid is written by hand per dialect, and that is the entire
per-warehouse surface area of this engine. Everything else is one emitter.
